This project implements a face detection and processing pipeline using Python and OpenCV. It combines pre-trained DNN models and Haar cascades to detect faces and eyes in images, process them for enhanced visibility, and apply privacy-focused blurring techniques as needed. The solution is designed for robust performance across diverse datasets with single and multiple subjects.
